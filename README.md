## Introduction

A **control chart** is a Statistical device principally used for the study and control of repetitive process.
Quality control Charts are divided into two:
1. Control Charts for Variables.
2. Control Charts for Attributes.
- Control Charts for <code>variables</code> are used on **variable data** i.e if the observations are **Continuous**.
- Control Charts for <code>Attributes</code> are used on **attribute data** i.e if the observerations are **Discrete**.
**Examples of Control Charts for Variables and what they control:**
- x-bar Charts - Process Average
- Range Charts - Process Variation
- s chart - Process Variation
- mR chart - Process Variation
- CUSUM(Cummulative sum of deviation) chart - Process Average.
**Examples of Control Charts for attributes and what they control:**
-p chart : It is used to control proportion for noncomforming items in successive subgroups 
- np chart - It is used to control number of Noncomforming items in successive subgroups, np chart is used instead of p chart when the subgroup sizes varies.
- C chart - Number of noncomforming items per inspection unit
- U chart - Number of noncomforming items per inspection unit, U chart is used instead of C chart when the Size of each inspection unit varies.
